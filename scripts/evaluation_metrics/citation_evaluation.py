    Evaluates an embedding model's performance in citation classification using cosine similarity.

# Commentary on Missing Elements:
# 1. **Embedding Model**: Ensure your separate script provides a robust embedding model, and the `model.encode`
#    method returns meaningful vector representations for the input titles.
# 2. **Optimal Threshold**: The script uses a fixed threshold of 0.5. Depending on your use case, consider
#    experimenting with different thresholds or using a validation set to find the optimal one.
# 3. **Data Format**: Make sure your input data (title pairs and labels) are preprocessed and structured
#    as expected by this script.
